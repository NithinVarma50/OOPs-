        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a method of programming where we think in terms of **objects** instead of just functions. Each object contains its own data (called attributes) and actions (called methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea of OOP is to make programs more **organized and reusable**. By using classes and objects, it becomes easier to model real-world situations, like creating a `Car` class to represent different cars.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP also gives advantages such as code reusability, better structure, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A class is like a **blueprint** for creating objects. It defines what data the objects will have and what actions they can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, brand, color):\n",
        "        self.brand = brand\n",
        "        self.color = color\n",
        "\n",
        "    def start(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.brand} car has started\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the class `Car` defines that every car object will have a brand, a color, and a method to start.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "An object is an **instance of a class**, meaning it is created using the class blueprint. Each object can have its own values for the attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Tesla\", \"Red\")\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"BMW\", \"Black\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Abstraction** means hiding the complex details and only showing the important features. For example, when we use the `len()` function, we don’t need to know how it works internally; we just use it.\n",
        "* **Encapsulation** means keeping the data safe inside a class and restricting direct access. For example, in a bank account class, the balance can be kept private and updated only through deposit or withdraw methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, abstraction focuses on **what a system does**, while encapsulation focuses on **how the data is protected**.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Dunder methods (also called magic methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores, like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`. They allow us to customize how objects behave.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Book:\n",

        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"Book: {self.title}\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, using `__str__` makes the object print in a readable way instead of showing a memory address.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child) to use the properties and methods of another class (parent). This avoids writing the same code again and makes it easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",

        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bark!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `Dog` inherits from `Animal` but changes the `speak()` method. Inheritance is useful because it supports code reusability and shows a clear relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism means **“one name, many forms.”** In OOP, it allows the same function or method name to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Bird:\n",
        "    def fly(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bird is flying\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Sparrow(Bird):\n",
        "    def fly(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Sparrow flies high\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Penguin(Bird):\n",
        "    def fly(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Penguins cannot fly\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, all classes have the method `fly()`, but the output changes depending on which object is used. This is polymorphism in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is done by making variables **private** using a double underscore (`__`). Then we provide methods (getters and setters) to access or modify them safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Bank:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
        "        self.__balance = balance   # private variable\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
        "        self.__balance += amount\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def get_balance(self):\n",
        "        return self.__balance\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the balance cannot be changed directly from outside the class. It can only be modified using methods like `deposit()`. This keeps the data safe and controlled.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method called `__init__`. It is executed automatically when a new object is created. The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever we create a `Student` object, the constructor runs and sets the name and age values.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Python provides two special types of methods inside classes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class Method (`@classmethod`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Works with the class itself, not the individual object.\n",
        "   * Takes `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Static Method (`@staticmethod`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * A method inside the class that does not need access to class or object data.\n",
        "   * Works like a normal function but kept inside the class for better organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Math:\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def cls_method(cls):\n",
        "        print(\"This is a class method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def static_method():\n",
        "        print(\"This is a static method\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method overloading means having **multiple methods with the same name but different parameters**. Strictly speaking, Python does not support traditional overloading like Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "But in Python, we can achieve a similar effect by using **default arguments** or `*args`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Math:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the method `add()` can work with two numbers or three numbers, depending on how many arguments we pass.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method overriding happens when a **child class provides its own version** of a method that is already defined in the parent class. The child class method replaces the parent method when called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `Dog` overrides the `sound()` method of `Animal`. When we call it on a `Dog` object, it uses the child’s method, not the parent’s.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The `@property` decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a **read-only attribute**. It allows us to access a method like an attribute without explicitly calling it with `()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Circle:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "        self.radius = radius\n",

        "    @property\n",
        "    def area(self):\n",
        "        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius\n",
        "\n",
        "c = Circle(5)\n",
        "print(c.area)   # Accessed like an attribute\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `area` is written like a method but can be used as if it were a normal attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism is important because it makes code **flexible and reusable**. It allows the same method name to work differently depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, `Dog.speak()` and `Cat.speak()` can both be called using the same method name `speak()`, but they give different outputs. This means we can write general code that works for multiple object types without rewriting everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly instantiated. It is used to define methods that must be implemented in child classes. Abstract classes are created using the `abc` module and `@abstractmethod`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "    def area(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, any class that inherits `Shape` must implement the `area()` method. Abstract classes help enforce a structure in the program.\n",

        "The main advantages of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reusability** – Code can be reused using inheritance.\n",
        "2. **Modularity** – Classes break large problems into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
        "3. **Flexibility** – Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different purposes.\n",
        "4. **Security** – Encapsulation hides sensitive data.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The `__del__` method is called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). It is like a **destructor**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Test:\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Object is being deleted\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "It is not commonly used, but it can be helpful for cleanup tasks like closing files or connections.\n",

        "### **Q22. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **@staticmethod** → Does not take `self` or `cls`. Works like a normal function inside the class.\n",
        "* **@classmethod** → Takes `cls` as the first parameter and can modify class-level variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Demo:\n",

        "    def change_school(cls, new_name):\n",
        "        cls.school = new_name\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "### **Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Polymorphism with inheritance means a child class can redefine methods from the parent class, and the correct method will be chosen depending on the object used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self): print(\"Animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self): print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self): print(\"Meow\")\n",
        "\n",
        "for animal in [Dog(), Cat()]:\n",
        "    animal.speak()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line. For this to work, each method must return the object (`self`).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        return self\n",
        "    def set_age(self, age):\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "        return self\n",
        "\n",
        "p = Person().set_name(\"John\").set_age(25)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, methods are chained together because they return `self`.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "The `__call__` method makes an object behave like a function. If a class defines `__call__`, its objects can be called using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Adder:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
        "        self.value = value\n",
        "    def __call__(self, x):\n",
        "        return self.value + x\n",
        "\n",
        "add5 = Adder(5)\n",
        "print(add5(10))   # Output: 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
